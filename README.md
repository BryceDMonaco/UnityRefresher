# UnityRefresher
 Contains all of my work following official Unity courses to refresh myself with the software. I felt that I have not been able to keep myself up to date with the latest Unity changes, so I decided to follow the offical courses provided by Unity to help refresh myself and ensure that I am working with the latest tools provided.
